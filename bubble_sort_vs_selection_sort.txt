⚔️ Bubble Sort vs. Selection Sort: A Speed Showdown
| Feature | Bubble Sort | Selection Sort | 
| Time Complexity | O(n²) in all cases | O(n²) in all cases | 
| Best Case Speed | O(n) with optimization (already sorted) | O(n²) even if already sorted | 
| Swaps Count | High (multiple per pass) | Minimal (1 swap per pass) | 
| Comparison Count | Depends on data, potentially many | Fixed pattern, n(n−1)/2 comparisons | 
| In-Place? | Yes | Yes | 
| Stable Sort? | Yes | No | 


🧠 Which Is Faster?
- In practice, selection sort can edge out bubble sort slightly because it performs fewer swaps, which matters if swapping is expensive.
- However, if the data is nearly sorted and you're using an optimized bubble sort (e.g. early exit when no swaps occur), bubble sort can be faster due to fewer iterations.
